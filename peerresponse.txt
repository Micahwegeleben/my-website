Peer response 2:
-Fixed absolute footers. I thought I did but it still was broken on 1080p. I use 1440p and realize now my website looks AWFUL on lower resolutions... I tried and tried, but can't figure out how to fix it.
-Added buttons
-Filled in placeholder information with pretty bad info, will update as I use it!
